        <h1>April Fools!</h1>
        <p>I got you so good, didn't I? <br> Here is my real letter, because I'm not trying to plagarize Mary's heart and soul.</p>
        <p>Dear Colter Wolter,<br><br>Sorry for the late April Fool's Day prank, but I had to show off my incredible coding skills.
        How else are you going to see how much those Computer Science classes have paid off? Personally, I agree with your mom - I think you
        should take CS too. I might be a little bit biased, but it's so much fun. And you can make websites whenever you want! My portfolio is already
        so huge! Just think about all the incredible possibilities!<br><br>I hope school is going well for you. One final push and then it's summer and we are home free.
        However then after that you'll have to start thinking about what you're going to do with your life because you'll be a senior (loser).
        Don't despair, I'll be thinking about the same things, because next year I'll be a junior in college. I took so many credits in HS that if things go well,
        I'm going to graduate a year early - technically right now, I'm a sophomore. It's so scary.<br><br>I just went over some paperwork for my apartment next
        year, and it's all starting to feel so real. I can't wait, I hope you can come visit me there next year. Speaking of visiting, I'm sorry for being mean about
        it on the phone the other day. It just really breaks my heart when you talk about wanting to visit but it never happens. I would love for you
        to visit me, but my heart is too big and fragile and my hopes get up too high, so they both get crushed very easily.<br><br>I need to do my actual coding assignment 
        now, so I'll end this letter here. I hope you have an amazing month. I'll see you in June. I miss you a lot a lot a lot bestie. Tell your mom hi for me and tell 
        her that I miss her too. I love you!</p>
        <p>♡♡,<br>Lucy</p>
